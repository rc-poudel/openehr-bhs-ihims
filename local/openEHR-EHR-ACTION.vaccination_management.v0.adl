			use = <"Use to record details about any activity related to the process of planning, scheduling, administration and notification of a single vaccine item, including deviations from the intended care path such as postponement and cancellation. This is achieved by the recording of relevant data elements about specific activities, each of which are described as the 'Pathway' careflow steps in this archetype.

This archetype is intended to be used to record a record of progress of vaccination against any planned vaccination. 

Within the context of a Vaccination List, this archetype will be used to record only what vaccination has been administered.

Timings related to vaccine management can be managed in one of two ways:
- Using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step.
- Archetyped data elements - the 'Scheduled date/time' data element is intended to record the time when the vaccine item was intended to be administered. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the clinical activity was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the activity is intended to be carried out.

In practice, overarching care plans can incorporate age-, gender- and clinical context-appropriate vaccination plans, usually generated on the basis of accepted local vaccination protocols or guidelines and recorded in the health record in a variety of ways:
- using a single order that describes an entire vaccination schedule appropriate for the individual's age, gender and clinical context;
- a single order for a course of multiple vaccinations (primary course +/- boosters) for a target disease; or
- one or more orders that each describe a single individual vaccination. 

Some travel-related vaccinations may require a clinician to generate a prescription for a vaccine that is not commonly available at the vaccination centre - this will require generation of a prescription, using the INSTRUCTION.medication_order archetypes. 

Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will most commonly be the administration of the vaccine item itself, be used to record cancellation of a vaccination due to withdrawal of consent. When the activities follow the usual Planned > Scheduled > Active > Completed states, recording a 'Reason' is not usually necessary - rather, it is usually used to record the reason for deviation from the typical care pathway.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the order for a vaccination or a prescription for a vaccination - use INSTRUCTION.medication for this purpose.

Not to be used to record whether an individual is up-to-date with their vaccination for a target disease - use EVALUATION.vaccine_summary.">
