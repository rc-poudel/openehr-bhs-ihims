This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the ‘Examination detail’ SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes where clinically appropriate, such as CLUSTER.exam-rectum.v0 or CLUSTER.exam-vagina.v0.

Interpretation of the bleeding findings, such as ‘Bright red bleeding likely from distal source’ or ‘Scant altered blood of uncertain origin’, can be recorded using the ‘Clinical interpretation’ data element.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the ‘Examination not done’ SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate narrative descriptions of bleeding within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the ‘Clinical description’ data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording clinical history, such as a patient's reported episodes of bleeding – use OBSERVATION.story or CLUSTER.symptom_sign for this purpose.

Not to be used for quantifying blood loss over time or measuring blood as a type of fluid output – use OBSERVATION.fluid_output-blood.v0 for that purpose, especially when the focus is on the volume or rate of blood loss (e.g. postoperative drainage, menstrual flow, or hemorrhage in critical care).">
